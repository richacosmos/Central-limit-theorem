# Central-limit-theorem
In probability and simulations, central limit theorem is very important.  
According to the Central limit theorem:
given a sufficiently large sample
a)The mean of each sample taken from the population will be approximately normally distributed
b)This normal distribution will have a mean close to the mean of population
c)The variance of sample mean will be the variance of population divided by the sample size
